## Bug Reports

Please use the [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere/issues). As always, please search first to see if your issue has already been submitted.

## Learning the Code

Our API contains many extensions to the [OpenLayers](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers) API, so it would help to get familiar with Layers, Sources, Features, and Geometries from some of their [examples](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/) and [documentation](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/).

There are `readme.md` files placed in various packages to help explain the different stacks. The root [readme](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/master/src/README.md) has a high level overview of everything.

## Contributing Code

Our [developer guide](http://opensphere.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) has an overview of the build system, development, and testing the application in both compiled and debug modes.

We prefer that all contributions take place through [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Please ensure that your pull request passes our pull request checklist below before submitting it.
