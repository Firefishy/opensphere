    Please provide a valid XYZ tile layer URL.
    <br>
    <br>
    An XYZ tile layer URL can have many different formats, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>https://example.com/layer_1/{z}/{x}/{y}</li>
      <li>https://example.com/layer_2/{z}/{y}/{x}</li>
      <li>https://example.com/layer_3/{z}/{x}/{y}.png</li>
    </ul>
    Keep in mind that the positions of {x}, {y}, and {z} can vary between URLs.
    <br>
    <br>
    Although the {x}, {y}, and {z} portions of each URL can be replaced with an integer value, it is not recommended to do so as this will only provide a single tile of the layer.
    <br>
    <br>
    Two projections are currently supported for XYZ tile layers: EPSG:3857 and EPSG:4326. If an XYZ tile layer does not appear as expected, consider reimporting it with a different projection.
